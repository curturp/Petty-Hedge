# Petty Hedge

**Petty Hedge is a Tower Defense-like Maze Building game.**

## Introduction

Originally developed for the Weekly Game Jam #191, Petty Hedge was developed in roughly four days. It was made by implementing A* Pathfinding, a procedurally generated maze, and a wall placment system. Out of 18 entries, it won First Place in "Creativity" and "Mechanics," and won Fourth Place overall. I plan on continuing development of this project with a focus on a mobile and PC releases.

## Future Plans

My main goal as a developer is to implement robust and meaningful accessibility features into all my games. Modular Difficult, Color Blind Options, Legible Text / Subtitles, Conrol Remapping, etc. As such, many of my plans for the development of this project revolve around that. Beyond accessibility, I'm currently working out the details on an overall direction for the project. There are many paths I could take with this game: Pre-Made Puzzels in the form of Levels, A Level Editor, A multi-player aspect where one person builds the maze while the other navigates, a "ghost race" style mode where at first you build the maze while the AI goes through it followed by you navigating through the maze while the walls you built up based on the first session, and so much more. However, overall, these are my current goals:

* Replace A* Pathfinding with a custom Pathfinding Algorithm in order to have more control over the accuracy of the pathfinder.

* Expand on the Maze Building Algroithm in order to generate different styles of mazes.

* Implement Art, Animations, SFX, and more.
